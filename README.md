# Breaking-Cifar
Tests and tries. Experiments I've ran with a modified code from here https://github.com/szagoruyko/wide-residual-networks which is a modified code from here https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch . Best result so far ~18.3% error on Cifar-100. Which might be just about the best result so far overall. ᕙ(^▿^-ᕙ) 

If you'll notice any bugs, please, let know.
